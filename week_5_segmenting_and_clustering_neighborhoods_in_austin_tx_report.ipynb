    "Austin is a new fast-growing city in central Texas with great potential for many young families. The first thing to solve before you decided to move to your new place will be a locating right spot on the map to stay. And as for big family, it's really critical to have a Park in close proximity from your home. So, in this project, we're going to apply data science methodology to identify the right neighborhood for the new family in Austin, TX.\n",

    "The list of Austin neighbourhoods with a total of 50 neighbourhoods. We will use web scraping techniques to extract the data from the ZipDataMaps page, with the help of Fiddler and Postman utilities and some python scripting. Dataset was carefully crafted, filtered and placed as Austin_Zip_Loc.csv file (available on GitHub project page as an input data)\n",
    "\n",

    "Firstly, we need to get the list of neighbourhoods in Austin, TX. Data we needed for the project is available on https://www.zipdatamaps.com/zipcodes-austin-tx. We will do web scraping using Fiddler and Postman tools (to identify http endpoints available and query data via REST API available). Lucaly for us, we will get geographical coordinates along with zip codes and names of naiborhoods so we can proceed to the next step. So as a result - we got a csv file with basic data we need to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, enrich data with venues is not such a big deal if you use Foursquare API\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will use Foursquare API to get the top 200 venues that are within a radius of 12 miles. We need to register a Foursquare Developer Account in order to obtain the Foursquare ID and Foursquare secret key. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then make API calls to Foursquare passing in the geographical coordinates of the neighbourhoods in a Python loop. Foursquare will return the venue data in JSON format and we will extract the venue name, venue category, venue latitude and longitude. With the data, we can check how many venues were returned for each neighbourhood and examine how\n",
    "many unique categories can be curated from all the returned venues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we will analyse each neighbourhood by grouping the rows by neighbourhood and taking the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each venue category. By doing so, we are also preparing the data for use in clustering. Since we are analysing the “Parks” data, we will filter the “Parks” as venue category for the neighbourhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we will perform clustering on the data by using k-means clustering. K-means clustering\n",
    "the algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest\n",
    "cluster, with an optimal number of centroids. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms and is particularly suited to solve the problem for this project. We will cluster the neighbourhoods into 7 clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the occurrence of parks in different neighbourhoods, it will help us to answer the question as to which neighbourhoods are most suitable to stay."
